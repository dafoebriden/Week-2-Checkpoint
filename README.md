This applicaiton is a clicker game called MoonMiner that uses html css and bootsrap.
The goal of the game is to get as many moon rocks as possible and to purchase all of the available upgrades.

I built this application at the end of the second week of my time at Codeworks Boise. 
The goal was to build a clicker game similar the well known Cookie clicker.
There are many things that could be improved in this application as it is and many additions that could be made.
I have left it the way it is so that I can look back on the ways that I have improved.
Hope you enjoy!
